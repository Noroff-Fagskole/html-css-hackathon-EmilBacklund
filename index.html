              <h1>CSS Basics: The Second “S” in CSS - Heading</h1>
              <time>Geoff Graham on Feb 14, 2018 (Updated on Feb 21, 2018)</time>
            </header>
            <p>CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
            <p>
              While most of the discussion about CSS on the web (or even here on
              CSS-Tricks) is centered around writing styles and how the cascade
              affects them, what we don’t talk a whole lot about is the sheet part
              of the language. So let’s give that lonely second “S” a little bit
              of the spotlight and understand what we mean when we say CSS is a
              style sheet.
            </p>
            <h2>The Sheet Contains the Styles - Heading</h2>
            <p>
              The cascade describes how styles interact with one another. The
              styles make up the actual code. Then there’s the sheet that contains
              that code. Like a sheet of paper that we write on, the “sheet” of
              CSS is the digital file where styles are coded.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we were to illustrate this, the relationship between the three
              sort of forms a cascade:
            </p>
            <img src="/img/img1.jpeg" alt="" />
            <p>
              There can be multiple sheets all continuing multiple styles all
              associated with one HTML document. The combination of those and the
              processes of figuring out what styles take precedence to style what
              elements is called the cascade (That first “C” in CSS).
            </p>
            <h2>The Sheet is a Digital File - Heading</h2>
            <p>
              The sheet is such a special thing that it’s been given its own file
              extension: .css. You have the power to create these files on your
              own. Creating a CSS file can be done in any text editor. They are
              literally text files. Not “rich text” documents or Word documents,
              but plain ol’ text.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re on Mac, then you can fire up TextEdit to start writing
              CSS. Just make sure it’s in “Plain Text” mode.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/img2.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              If you’re on Windows, the default Notepad app is the equivalent.
              Heck, you can type styles in just about any plain text editor to
              write CSS, even if that’s not what it says it was designed to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whatever tool you use, the key is to save your document as a .css
              file. This can usually be done by simply add that to your file name
              when saving. Here’s how that looks in TextEdit:
            </p>
            <img src="/img/img3.gif" alt="" />
            <p>
              Seriously, the choice of which text editor to use for writing CSS is
              totally up to you. There are many, many to choose from, but here are
              a few popular ones:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sublime Text</il>
              <li>Atom</il>
              <li>VIM</il>
              <li>PhpStorm</il>
              <li>Coda </il>
              <li>Dreamweaver</il>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You might reach for one of those because they’ll do handy things for
              you like syntax highlight the code (colorize different parts to help
              it be easier to understand what is what).
            </p>
            <p>
              Hey look I made some files completely from scratch with my text
              editor:
            </p>
            <img src="/img/img4.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              Those files are 100% valid in any web browser, new or old. We’ve
              quite literally just made a website.
            </p>
            <p>The Sheet is Linked Up to the HTML</p>
            <p>
              We do need to connect the HTML and CSS though. As in make sure the
              styles we wrote in our sheet get loaded onto the web page.
            </p>
            <p>A webpage without CSS is pretty barebones:</p>
          </article>
          <aside class="app-sidebar">Sidebar</aside>
        </section>
      </div>
    </main>
    <footer><div class="inner">
      <i class="fab fa-twitter iconstyle"></i>
      <i class="fab fa-facebook iconstyle"></i>
      <i class="fab fa-discord iconstyle"></i>
      <i class="fab fa-behance iconstyle"></i>
      <i class="fab fa-instagram iconstyle"></i>
    </div></footer>
  </body>
</html>
